% Convert a C7 struct to python dict with real lists instead of memoryviews.
%
% When Matlab convertes a struct to a python dict 2d arrays are converted to a
% python memoryview object. Their data is not copied. This is usually fine but
% it makes it hard to serialize with pickle or json. So here we loop over the
% relevant dict keys and manually populae them with the full data, by calls the
% the memoryview.tolist() method, making them nested lists.
%
% With nonempty dumpname the output dict will also be json.dumped to that file.
